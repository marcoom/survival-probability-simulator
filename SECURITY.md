| `main`  | Yes |
| Anything before the latest release tag | No |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Use GitHub’s private **“Report a vulnerability”** feature found under the **Security** tab of this repository.
- If that option is unavailable, open a new GitHub *Issue* and add the `security` label. Keep details concise; the maintainer will request further information privately if needed.
- **No email contact is provided.** All communication should occur through GitHub.

When reporting, please include:

1. A clear description of the vulnerability.
2. Steps to reproduce (proof‑of‑concept code or commands).
3. The potential impact.

---

## Response Expectations

- Reports are handled on a **best‑effort** basis; there is **no guaranteed response time**.
- The maintainer will acknowledge the report once reviewed and may request additional details.
- Fixes will be released when ready. Timing depends on severity and available resources.

---

## Severity Classification (Simple Scheme)

- **High**   — Remote code execution, unauthorized data access, or other critical impact.
- **Medium** — Denial of service, significant malfunction, or limited data disclosure.
- **Low**     — Minor issues, edge‑case bugs with minimal impact.

## Scripts

### `preprocess_data.py`
Cleans and preprocesses the raw Titanic dataset for model training and visualization.

**Key Operations**:
- Handles missing values with group-based median imputation
- Removes outliers using 3-standard-deviation rule
- Engineers features (child flag, one-hot encoding)
- Applies appropriate scaling (custom age, MinMax for siblings/parents, StandardScaler for fare)
- Saves processed data to `data/titanic_processed.parquet`

**Usage**: `python scripts/preprocess_data.py`

### `train_model.py`
Trains the Random Forest model using the processed dataset and saves complete pipeline.

**Key Operations**:
- Creates sklearn Pipeline with preprocessing and Random Forest classifier
- Uses optimized hyperparameters (n_estimators=1000, max_depth=9, etc.)
- Evaluates model performance and displays metrics
- Saves complete pipeline to `model/titanic_model_pipeline.joblib`

**Usage**: `python scripts/train_model.py`

**Note**: These scripts are provided for reference and reproducibility. The processed data (`titanic_processed.parquet`) and trained model (`titanic_model_pipeline.joblib`) are already included in the repository. The raw dataset (`titanic_raw.csv`) is the official Kaggle Titanic competition dataset.

**Execution Order** (if rebuilding from scratch):
1. First run `preprocess_data.py` to generate processed data
2. Then run `train_model.py` to train and save the model

## Model Performance

### Random Forest Classifier Metrics
- **Accuracy**: ~86%
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: GridSearchCV with 3-fold cross-validation
- **Model Configuration**:
  - 1000 decision trees (n_estimators=1000)
  - Maximum depth: 9 levels
  - Bootstrap sampling enabled
  - Feature subsampling: 20% per tree
  - Sample subsampling: 20% per tree

### Feature Importance (Top Contributors)
1. **Fare**: Ticket price - strongest predictor of survival
2. **Gender (Male)**: Male passengers had significantly lower survival rates
3. **Age**: Younger passengers, especially children, had higher survival rates
4. **Passenger Class**: First-class passengers had better survival odds
5. **Embarkation Port**: Cherbourg passengers (wealthier) had higher survival rates

### Key Insights
- **Wealth Factor**: Higher ticket fares strongly correlated with survival
- **"Women and Children First"**: Clear gender and age bias in rescue protocol
- **Class Distinction**: Socioeconomic status significantly impacted survival odds
- **Port Influence**: Embarkation port served as proxy for passenger wealth
